Course Description:

Ansys parametric design language (APDL) is a scripting language that is used to communicate with the Ansys Mechanical APDL program. It is routinely used in performing parametric design analysis, automating workflows, or even in developing vertical applications for industry-specific problems. In this course, we will introduce the basics of APDL language and its usage in performing general finite element simulations.
